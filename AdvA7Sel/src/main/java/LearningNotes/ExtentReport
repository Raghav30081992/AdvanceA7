Extent Report:

 Extent Reports is an open-source reporting library useful for test automation. 
It can be easily integrated with major testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, etc.
 These reports are HTML documents.
 They also allow the generation of custom logs, snapshots, and other customized details.
 Once an automated test script runs successfully, testers need to generate a test execution report.
 While TestNG does provide a default report, they do not provide the details.

Extent Reports in Selenium contain two major, frequently used classes
 ExtentReports class
 ExtentTest class

Syntax :
ExtentSparkReporter reporter=new ExtentSparkReporter("Path of directory to store the resultant HTML file");
ExtentReports reports = new ExtentReports();
reports.attachReporter(reporter);
ExtentTest test = reports.createTest("Extent Test");
Reports.flush();
